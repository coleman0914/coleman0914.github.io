Today I worked on a PCB milling workflow and milled a small board using the Canvera machine. This was my first time using this equipment and I enjoyed the process — I documented the main steps and took photos that I'll add once they're organized.

- Workflow (MakerA): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CaDUQ4LmfPJc6pKK6p19hoUctoCXxTt6e9c5fYZ9dEQ/edit
- Canvera workflow: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hm03u70SZn6hg4F6Bugsz9wwq4C9IR7cGyQyIbE5Zmo/edit?tab=t.0

G-code file: See the `assets/files/` directory for the exported G-code (the file is currently in `assets/files/` — consider renaming it to a safe filename without spaces for easier linking).

Images: I added photos to `assets/images/`; I'll update this post to embed images using standard Markdown once I confirm the filenames.

Notes / next steps:

- Rename the G-code file to remove spaces and special characters (recommended example: `pcb-board-canvera.nc`).
- Add any photos to `assets/images/` and update the image links below, for example:

  ![Finished PCB](/assets/images/pcb-finished.jpg)

If you push this change to your `master` branch on GitHub Pages the post will appear (Jekyll looks for `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` files and front-matter). If you want, I can also rename the G-code file and add the images into `assets/images/` and embed them in the post.
