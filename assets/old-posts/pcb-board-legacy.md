PCB milling project (legacy copy)

PCB milling project: Today I made a workflow and milled my board using Canvera. All of the key steps for milling are on this workflow - and I enjoyed using this machine because it was my first time interacting with this new technology and it was interesting to see. I took some pictures of the process and will document those once I organize it.
