PCB milling project: Today I made a workflow and milled my board using canvera.All of the key steps for milling is on this workflow- and I enjoyed using this machine because it was my first time interacting with this new technology and it was interesting to see. I took some pictures of the process and will document those once I organize it- the link to the workflow is here.
