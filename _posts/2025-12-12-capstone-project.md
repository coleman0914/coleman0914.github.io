RESEARCH
Description of final project choice, why chosen, and what a successful project would do:

My final project is a smart stool that combines making a stool with basic electronics. I chose this project because it allowed me to work with both physical components and electronics, which interested me more than doing only one or the other. I wanted to create something functional and interactive rather than just decorative, but at the same time I did not want to make something so hard because of my lack of experience in engineering. 

A successful version of this project: 

It will function as a normal stool but also include a pressure sensor that detects when someone sits down. When pressure is applied, LED lights embedded in the stool will turn on, creating a visual response to the user. The electronics will be hidden underneath the stool so the design looks clean and intentional, with only the light visible. If completed successfully, the stool will be sturdy, visually appealing, and reliably respond to pressure.

Attribution of project serving as inspiration (author/maker and source):

This project is inspired by me searching on youtube for electronic ideas and sources that could be interesting to make into a final project that is also doable. Descriptions of the youtube videos are below and these include some of my inspirations for the electronic portions. For the wood portions some of the videos are also below, because I knew I wanted to include some woodworking so I looked for videos on that.

Description of how project is different than these sources that I got my inspiration from:

Unlike the electronics focused videos only or the woodworking video that focuses only on electronics or only on furniture design, my project combines building furniture with embedded electronics. Instead of attaching LEDs externally or making a small prototype, I am building a full-size stool with electronics fully hidden inside. I also designed my own stool dimensions and structure rather than copying an existing furniture plan. This makes my project more personalized and fabrication-focused than the videos that only include one small portion of engineering that I watched to get inspiration for my own project. They jumpstarted my brain in terms of what I would like to do but combining many different aspects into one project is how what I will build differs from the source. 

Design Specification Considerations

When figuring this portion out I relied heavily on my design document that I completed in the beginning of the year, eg: the material choice, testing what dimensions would be the most adequate based on my weight/average weight. 

When designing my stool, I considered:

Size and scale so it can support a person safely(200+ lbs because that is what I weigh)
base diameter is 22.5 inches with wood that has a radius of .75+ inches and 18-20 inch legs 

Material choice, starting with cardboard prototypes before moving to wood

Placement of electronics so they are hidden and protected(under the bottom of the stool)

Ease of assembly and maintenance in case electronics need adjustment

Visual simplicity, ensuring the LEDs enhance the design rather than distract from it

These considerations have guided my physical design and they will guide my electronics layout when I complete it second semester.





INSTRUCTIONS:


Final materials list including costs: 

1-Cardboard (for prototyping)- at Latin

2-Wood (final stool structure)- At Latin

3-Arduino microcontroller- at Latin

4-Pressure sensor- will order with mr dubick in January- according to research should be 30/40 dollars

5-LEDs- at Latin(10/15 dollars)

6-Resistors- at latin

7-PCB board- at Latin

8-Wires- at Latin

9-Power source (battery or USB)- will obtain 

10- Wood glue, screws, sandpaper, finish- at Latin

Most electronics were provided through the lab or classroom supply, keeping costs low.

Project Management (plan and deadlines):
To be completed later as instructed.



TOOLS USED:



 (hand tools and Fab Lab equipment)
Laser cutter (for cardboard prototype pieces)

Sandpaper and sanding tools

Hand saw or band saw

Drill

Soldering iron

Arduino IDE (software tool)

Laser cutter settings were adjusted for cardboard settings( vector cut because I was only cutting- no engraving) to ensure clean cuts without burning.

image explanation: obviously the cardboard is not a full representation of the stool, but everything is the same except for the thickness of the base and legs. The length of the legs and diameter of the stool is what I was testing- and each component that I was testing is the appropriate height. To clarify: I have wood selected from the shed with those exact heights, diameter, and length of the legs. That will be completed in the first couple weeks of second semester, along with assembling the electronic components of which have mostly been gathered. That is the plan.

**Workflow & Photos**

I created a milling workflow and documented the process on October 30th. Below are direct links to the Google Docs for the workflow and the photos. If the docs are not publicly shared, publish them or enable "Anyone with the link can view" in Google Drive so Jekyll visitors can access them.

Important decisions and Why:

One of the biggest decisions I’ve made is to focus on building the physical stool first, and  that just makes the most sense to me. I want to know that the stool actually works as a stool before I start worrying about lights and wires and code. Figuring out the size and leg length now helps me avoid changing things later and having to redo parts of the electronics. I also decided to prototype everything in cardboard first because it let me mess around with proportions without stressing about wasting wood. Another choice I made was hiding all the electronics underneath so the stool still looks clean and intentional and not like something with parts glued on. All of these decisions kind of work together and help keep the project feeling doable instead of overwhelming.

Challenges/mistakes so far: 

One of the biggest challenges for me was  just getting started on the design specs, because I’ve never had to plan something like this in such a detailed way before. It was hard to figure out what information actually mattered and what I was supposed to decide this early on. At first I kept second-guessing myself and putting it off because I didn’t want to get something “wrong.” Once I started breaking it down into smaller decisions, like just focusing on size and materials, it became way less overwhelming. Prototyping in cardboard helped a lot because it let me physically see the design instead of just imagining it. After that, everything now has started to feel more real and manageable, and now I feel way more confident moving forward with the project.

This page will be updated as I continue to progress in the coming weeks and months.
