excerpt: "Documenting my first PCB milling workflow using the Canvera machine — includes workflow links, G-code notes, and photos. Today I worked on a PCB milling workflow and milled a small board using the Canvera machine. This was my first time using this equipment and I enjoyed the process — I documented the main steps and took photos that I'll add once they're organized.
