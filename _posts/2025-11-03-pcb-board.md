	Documenting my first PCB milling workflow using the Canvera machine —
	includes workflow links, G-code notes, and photos. I milled a small board and
	will add photos once they're organized.



Discussion of issues/mistakes, there wasnt much but I described what I did: I worked through a complete PCB milling workflow and milled a small PCB board on Canvera machine. I started by preparing the Gerber and drill files, importing the copper and edge cut layers into the CAM, and carefully setting the origin and board position so the toolpaths aligned with the physical stock. I chose tools for contouring, engraving and drilling, set conservative depths (multiple light passes rather than one deep cut), and added a few tabs to keep the board held in place during contouring. Before cutting I probed the surface, ran a dry run to verify the toolpaths and offsets, and confirmed the vacuum and leveling settings so the spindle wouldn't crash; during the run I monitored the first passes closely. After finishing I removed the board, cleaned up the tabs and edges, checked hole placement and everything else, it worked — I'll attach those photos here once they're organized.

4 pagraphs on what I learned during this project: 
- I began this project without much experience with CNC mills or the Canvera software, and the first few steps felt intimidating. Working through the import and setup taught me to slow down and verify each setting: import the Edge Cuts and copper layers, check the board scale, and set the origin precisely so the toolpaths line up with the physical stock.

- Choosing tools and depths turned out to be a lesson; smaller, sharper cutters for engraving and a 0.8 mm bit for contours worked best for this board. Setting conservative end depths and using multiple light passes (rather than a single deep cut) reduced tearout and helped preserve fine features.

- I also learned the value of verification routines: homing the machine, probing the surface, running a dry run, and watching the first 30–60 seconds of the job. Those checks,plus enabling auto‑vacuum and auto‑leveling,  are what keep runs safe and predictable, and they saved me from a few potential crashes.

- Beyond machining, the process taught me to document steps and manage files carefully: clear filenames for G‑code and images, and clean front matter for posts so content appears on the site. That small bit of working and publishing and sharing the worflow makes it easier. 


- Important decisions I made and why:
 I prioritized repeatability and safety;  I picked a 0.8 mm cutter for clean contouring and a small engraving bit for fine traces, used multiple shallow passes instead of deep cuts to avoid tearout, and added three offset tabs to hold the board securely during contouring. I also probed and ran a dry run before powering the spindle, enabled auto‑leveling and vacuum to keep the surface consistent, and kept file names clear so the G‑code and photos could be linked without errors. These choices cost a little time but prevented alignment errors and crashes and made the process much more reliable. Mr. Dubick gave these instructions briefly in class but I carried them out and focused on these crucial steps because one small mistake could have ruined everything. 

- Workflow (MakerA): Open project 3-axis
File → Import PCB → select Edge Cuts.gbr file
File → Import PCB → select F.Cu layer to add top layer copper file
File → Import PCB → select Resistance1-PTH.drl (drill file) to mark where the CNC should drill holes into the board
Select board and press M, set the anchor to the bottom left corner and move board to (6, 6)
*Note: If the object is dotted, it is selected. If it is solid, then it is not selected*
Go to top line, hit shift key and deselect the top line
Block the bottom three files
Select 2D Pocket to add a toolhead to the CNC
Set end depth to 0.05mm
Go to add tool → 0.8mm Corn
Go to add tool → 0.2mm*30 Engraving(Metal)
Select choose
Click calculate
Block everything but the drl files
Select everything and select 2D drilling
Set drill tip end depth to 1.7mm
Just add the 0.8mm Corn tool
calculate
Block everything but resistance edge cuts (Deselect top line and select bottom line)
2D contour
End depth 1.7mm
Tool 0.8mm Corn
Strategy: position is outside
Go to tabs → Custom → tabs → add → click on selected box (you want 3 tabs)
*Note: Don’t put tabs across each other! It will break the board. Make sure to offset them slightly*
Click preview at the top

- Canvera workflow: 1. Prepare and Load the Job
Open Canvera.
Go to Upload → Select G-code file (.gcode).
Verify the file loaded correctly in the preview window (check path visibility and scale).
Confirm offsets (X, Y, Z origin) are correctly set — use the Set Origin or Manual Offset tool if needed.
2. Machine Setup
Home the device — this ensures all axes return to their reference points.
Return to the Preview Interface once homing completes.
3. Probe and Level
Check probe height: the probe Z value should read > 3.6 mm before starting (to avoid crashes).
If prompted with “No remote file selected”, reselect your uploaded G-code file.
Double-check it appears in the bottom left corner under Active Job.
4. Pre-Run Checks
Open the Gear icon (Settings):
Enable Auto Vacuum (to keep dust clear).
Turn Auto Leveling ON — this ensures even milling depth across the board.
Optional but recommended:
Run a dry run (without spindle or laser ON) to confirm path movement.
5. Run the Job
Click Run.
Watch the initial toolpath closely — ensure:
The laser turns ON to outline the cut area (visual alignment).
The tool doesn’t drag across the surface unexpectedly.
6. Monitor and Finish
Observe the first 30–60 seconds for anomalies (tool height, vacuum suction, unexpected skipping).
Once milling starts cleanly, monitor periodically.
When finished:
Wait for vacuum to stop.
Remove the board only after the spindle/laser powers down.
