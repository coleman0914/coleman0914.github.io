Today I worked on a PCB milling workflow and milled a small board using the
Canvera machine. This was my first time using this equipment and I enjoyed the
process, and using the workflow made me realize how important the small details are when using these intricate machines — I documented the main steps and took photos that I'll add once
they're organized.


- Workflow (MakerA): Open project 3-axis
File → Import PCB → select Edge Cuts.gbr file
File → Import PCB → select F.Cu layer to add top layer copper file
File → Import PCB → select Resistance1-PTH.drl (drill file) to mark where the CNC should drill holes into the board
Select board and press M, set the anchor to the bottom left corner and move board to (6, 6)
*Note: If the object is dotted, it is selected. If it is solid, then it is not selected*
Go to top line, hit shift key and deselect the top line
Block the bottom three files
Select 2D Pocket to add a toolhead to the CNC
Set end depth to 0.05mm
Go to add tool → 0.8mm Corn
Go to add tool → 0.2mm*30 Engraving(Metal)
Select choose
Click calculate
Block everything but the drl files
Select everything and select 2D drilling
Set drill tip end depth to 1.7mm
Just add the 0.8mm Corn tool
calculate
Block everything but resistance edge cuts (Deselect top line and select bottom line)
2D contour
End depth 1.7mm
Tool 0.8mm Corn
Strategy: position is outside
Go to tabs → Custom → tabs → add → click on selected box (you want 3 tabs)
*Note: Don’t put tabs across each other! It will break the board. Make sure to offset them slightly*
Click preview at the top

- Canvera workflow: 1. Prepare and Load the Job
Open Canvera.
Go to Upload → Select G-code file (.gcode).
Verify the file loaded correctly in the preview window (check path visibility and scale).
Confirm offsets (X, Y, Z origin) are correctly set — use the Set Origin or Manual Offset tool if needed.
2. Machine Setup
Home the device — this ensures all axes return to their reference points.
Return to the Preview Interface once homing completes.
3. Probe and Level
Check probe height: the probe Z value should read > 3.6 mm before starting (to avoid crashes).
If prompted with “No remote file selected”, reselect your uploaded G-code file.
Double-check it appears in the bottom left corner under Active Job.
4. Pre-Run Checks
Open the Gear icon (Settings):
Enable Auto Vacuum (to keep dust clear).
Turn Auto Leveling ON — this ensures even milling depth across the board.
Optional but recommended:
Run a dry run (without spindle or laser ON) to confirm path movement.
5. Run the Job
Click Run.
Watch the initial toolpath closely — ensure:
The laser turns ON to outline the cut area (visual alignment).
The tool doesn’t drag across the surface unexpectedly.
6. Monitor and Finish
Observe the first 30–60 seconds for anomalies (tool height, vacuum suction, unexpected skipping).
Once milling starts cleanly, monitor periodically.
When finished:
Wait for vacuum to stop.
Remove the board only after the spindle/laser powers down.
