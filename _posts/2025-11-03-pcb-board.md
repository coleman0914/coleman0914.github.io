Today I worked on a PCB milling workflow and milled a small board using the
Canvera machine. This was my first time using this equipment and I enjoyed the
process — I documented the main steps and took photos that I'll add once
they're organized.

This is just a test.

G-code file: See the `assets/files/` directory for the exported G-code.

Images: I added photos to `assets/images/`; I'll update this post to embed images
using standard Markdown once I confirm the filenames.
