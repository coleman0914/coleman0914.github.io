Today was september 19th and I am reading  a book about chairs and the cnc for my project. I need to figure out in the coming days/weeks what excatly I am going to be doing for this project, even though I have the general idea down.
Today was september 24th and I am finalizing my project idea. I plan on creating a stool that when someone sits or stands on it the sensor will be there and the LED lights will turn on and flash around the stool.
For Sepetember 28-October 1st- I started and finsihed the owl project. On October 1st, I am starting to work on my project design with a tutorial in fusion 360.
8-25 through 9-12: construction of box and pen project. This involved getting our wood, trimming it down, cutting the hole inside the wood, using the turner, using glue to assemble the pen, and then assembling the final parts to get the pen working. I am documenting about this later on because Github had not been set up at this point. 
9-12-9-18- in class we learned about github, and I am writing about this now because I did not have my daily journal set up 9-12-9-18- in class we learned about github, and I am writing about this now because I did not have my daily journal set up 
October 7t- today I found the wood that I will be using for the base of my stool, and we took a quiz today in class.
Ocotober 9th and 10th- I found the wood that I will use for my project, and along with that in our 75 minute period on friday I refreshed my skills of the 3d printer and laser cutter by printing and cutting. (I learned how to focus one of the laser cutters with mr. dubick's help, and then I used what he taught me to practice focusing the cutter on my own.  )
October 14th- today I downloaded the jekyll template and I went through the config.yml file and added a new path to my photo. along with that, I added a bio and small description about myself in the config file. My digital portfolio is now made. 
October 16th
Documentation
Today I finalized and proofread all of this documentation, both the writing portion and the images. Then I gave Mr. Dubick the link.

October 17th 
Today Mr. Dubick taught us how to set up pages and posts in github. That is all we did in class today.

October 29th 
Today is my first day back. I had acl and meniscus surgery and was out for an entire week, but after 8 days I am back. We learned about making a tool path on makeracam, and some partners and I made a workflow about the steps with importing the pcbs, 2D drilling, 2D contouring, 2D drilling, choosing the different tools, and then previewing the tool path to make sure everything is right. I successfully made my file and sent it to drive as a resistor g code.nc file.

October 30th
Today I made a workflow and milled my board using canvera.All of the key steps for milling is on this workflow- and I enjoyed using this machine because it was my first time interacting with this new technology and it was interesting to see. I took some pictures of the process and will document those once I organize it- the link to the workflow is here.

From Nov 3–6 I worked on two hands‑on projects and the site housekeeping to publish them: I milled a small PCB on the Canvera machine (documenting the workflow and exporting G‑code), finished a pen‑turning project (including a failed first attempt and a successful second try), and cleaned up the Jekyll posts so they publish—fixing a malformed front matter, adding the right categories so posts show in the archive, and renaming a couple of images so they load on the site.
From Nov 11-20 I learned about topography- learned aspire and how to manipulate the x y z planes and then used bantam and homing and all the proper features to mill my mountain range which was of Cashiers, NC- where I spend some time in the mountains in the summer. - for more detail look at topography post on jekyll
Nov 20- dec 1- thanksgiving break 
Dec 1- 8- this week we worked on electronics in tinkercad- Mr dubick said we dont need a large description for this
Dec 9- today I created my topography post for my jekyll- now my jekyll is fully up to date with pen-owl-topography and other projects. 
Dec 11- 18 in these days
 I created my carboard prototype and got the dimensions down along with making sure the legs and base were both long enough. The images and description are seen above on images and files and under "image description" above. Besides that there has been lots of documentation including updating the topo post based on the rubric Mr. Dubick gave. 

 Jan 5-9: This week I fixed my documentation errors which Mr. Dubick left feedback for on monday. this included adding some links from youtube and workflows to give more detail about the start of my project. On tuesday and wednesday I started on my task analysis to give me a good timeline for my project and made the outline on google docs- shared with Mr. Dubick. On Thursday and Friday I focused on ordering the necessary parts for my project, which included a Load cell, amplifer, and wood for the stool which I will assemble in a timely fashion from the task analysis I made. The legs have a thickness of 2 by 2 and have a length of roughly 21 or 22 inches each. 

 Friday Jan 9: the wood is ordered and so should the other parts: next week I plan to practice working with the arduinos and practicing using jumpers, LEDS, and a breadboard to get me back in the mindset of coding and using electronics. I may do some work on tinkercad also. 


Week of Jan 12-16: this week the wood came and it was time to get working on the wood component of this project. This involved me measuring and scaling dimensions to make sure that each legs will have the same length. For the width, I need to smooth out the edges of the wood because the legs will need to be round and smooth instead of just the unsmoothed rectangles that they came as. This involves using the cnc machine and the wood trimmers in the lab to complete this portion of the project. Overall this was a good and productive week to get the wood component of my project started. I also watched a video and did some research on cnc machines as I may need to use our cnc machine in my project, but I am not too famaliar with them right now. It is very interesting however and this is the link to the video which I spent the class watching along with talking to Mr. Dubick about future applications with the wood involving joints and other possibilites: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rt5sC9DrEQ
