August 25 – September 12
Pen & Box Project
 During this time, we constructed a pen and a wooden box. This process included selecting the wood, trimming it, cutting a hole, using the lathe (turner), gluing, and assembling the final pieces to complete the pen. I really enjoyed this project. However, I encountered a challenge: part of my wood broke off while I was turning it. I documented this issue, and fortunately, on the second attempt, everything went smoothly and I was able to successfully finish the pen. This is all being documented on september 19th because we completed the pen project before setting up github.
steps:
The first step was to cut two pieces of t wood on the band saw, then cutting those in half to form 4 pieces of 0.5" thick wood. Then I was cutting 2 thin pieces of birch to put in between the pieces. Once I had all the pieces, I clamped and glued together the wood to form two blocks of wood with a thin piece of birch in the middle. I let the glue set overnight. While the glue was drying, I took the 2 brass barrels from the pen kit and made them rough by sanding them. This allows for the barrel to bond better with the superglue when they get glued inside the wood.
